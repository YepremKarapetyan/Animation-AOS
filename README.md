A simple project to demonstrate animations using **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** together with custom CSS transitions and effects.

**Animation-AOS** showcases how elements on a webpage can animate beautifully when they appear in the viewport during scrolling.  
It’s built using plain HTML, CSS, and the [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library, making it an excellent starting point for anyone learning frontend animation techniques.


- **index.html** – main demo page containing elements with AOS attributes.  
- **index.css** – custom styling and transition effects.  
- **assets/images/** – stores the animated logo or other assets used in the demo.
